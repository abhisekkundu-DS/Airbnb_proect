"""Analysis of Distribution of listings across neighborhoods by room type

The analysis provides insights into the distribution of listings across neighborhoods by room type:

Manhattan: Manhattan exhibits a higher number of entire homes/apartments compared to private rooms. This could be due to the high demand for complete spaces in this bustling borough. Like Brooklyn, shared rooms are also minimal here, suggesting that they are less popular among hosts and guests.

Brooklyn: This neighborhood has a balanced distribution of private rooms and entire homes/apartments listed on Airbnb. The number of shared rooms is significantly lower, indicating that hosts in Brooklyn prefer to list entire spaces or private rooms.

Queens: In Queens, there are more private rooms than entire homes/apartments. This could be due to the residential nature of this borough, where hosts might prefer to rent out spare rooms. The proportion of shared rooms is even smaller, following the trend observed in the other neighborhoods.

Staten Island: Staten Island has fewer listings overall but follows a similar pattern as Queens with more private rooms followed by entire homes/apartments. The number of shared rooms is very low, indicating that they are not a popular choice in this borough.

Bronx: The Bronx also follows this pattern but has the least number of listings among all neighborhoods. This could be due to various factors such as demand, property availability, or local regulations.

In summary, the distribution of Airbnb listings across these neighborhoods shows that entire homes/apartments and private rooms are the most popular room types, while shared rooms are less common. Each neighborhood has its unique characteristics, which are reflected in the types of listings available.

"""Analysis of Price VS Number of Reviews

From the scatter plot, we can make several observations:

Concentration of listings: There is a high concentration of listings with lower prices and a varying number of reviews. This suggests that more affordable listings tend to receive more reviews.

Outliers: There are a few listings with very high prices and a low number of reviews. These could be luxury listings or listings in high-demand locations that are rented less frequently due to their price.

Trend: As the price increases, the number of reviews decreases. This could indicate that guests are less likely to review more expensive listings, or it could suggest that more expensive listings are rented less frequently.

Correlation: There doesnâ€™t appear to be a strong correlation between price and the number of reviews. This suggests that other factors may be more influential in determining the number of reviews a listing receives.

In conclusion, the scatter plot provides a useful way to visualize and understand the relationship between the price of a listing and the number of reviews it has received in the Airbnb dataset. It helps identify trends and patterns in the data, which can be useful for hosts when setting prices or for guests when choosing a place to stay. However, itâ€™s important to remember that correlation does not imply causation, and further analysis would be needed to draw definitive conclusions

Average Reviews per Month by Neighbourhood Group :
The bar chart is used to compare the average reviews per month by neighbourhood group in the Airbnb dataset.The reason for using a bar chart for this comparison is that it allows us to see the differences between categories clearly.

"""Analysis of Correlation Heatmap

In the context of the Airbnb dataset, the correlation heatmap helps us understand the relationship between different variables. Hereâ€™s an analysis based on the heatmap:

   **â€˜idâ€™ and â€˜host_idâ€™:** A positive correlation of 0.59
suggests that listings from hosts with higher IDs tend to have higher listing IDs. This could be because newer hosts (with higher IDs) would create newer listings (also with higher IDs).

**â€˜latitudeâ€™ and â€˜longitudeâ€™:** These have low correlations with most other variables, indicating that the geographical location of the listings (as represented by these coordinates) does not have much linear relationship with other numerical features in the dataset.

**â€˜number_of_reviewsâ€™ and â€˜reviews_per_monthâ€™:** A moderate positive correlation of 0.55 suggests that listings with more reviews tend to have more reviews per month. This could indicate popular listings that consistently receive reviews.

**â€˜priceâ€™ and â€˜minimum_nightsâ€™:** A negative correlation of -0.15 indicates that listings requiring fewer minimum nights tend to be priced higher. This could be because listings with fewer minimum nights might be in higher demand, allowing for higher prices.

This heatmap is instrumental in understanding how different factors relate to each other within the Airbnb dataset. It can guide further analysis or model building by highlighting significant relationships. For example, if we were to predict the price of a listing, knowing that it has a negative correlation with minimum nights could be very useful. Similarly, understanding that the number of reviews and reviews per month are positively correlated could help in designing a review system or understanding user behavior.

Please note that correlation does not imply causation, and further investigation would be needed to draw definitive conclusions. Also, this analysis is based on the assumption that the data is accurate and reliable. Any inaccuracies in the data could affect the results of the analysis.

Comparison between Price vs Number of Reviews :
The scatter plot is used to compare the price and the number of reviews of listings in the Airbnb dataset. The reason for using a scatter plot for this comparison is that it allows us to see patterns in the data. Each point on the plot represents a listing, with its position on the horizontal axis showing its price and its position on the vertical axis showing the number of reviews it has received. This makes it easy to see at a glance how these two variables relate to each other for the different listings.
